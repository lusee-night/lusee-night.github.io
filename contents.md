LuSEE-Night is an exciting proposed collaboration between NASA and Department of Energy (DOE) to send a pathfinder radio telescope to the far side of the Moon. 

LuSEE stands for Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment. The full experiment is split into the LuSEE-Light component, which focuses on the Solar science and LuSEE-Night, which focuses on the galactic and extra-galactic radio astronomy at very low frequencies (0.1-50MHz).

LuSEE-Night is manifested to fly to the Moon on NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program flight CS-3 in early 2025. It will use the ESA's Lunar Pathfinder Communication Satellite to communicate with Earth. It will observe radio sky using 4 monopole antennas from the far side of the Moon for up to 24 lunar cycles after landing. Results will provide the most constraining measurements of the radio sky in this frequency range.
