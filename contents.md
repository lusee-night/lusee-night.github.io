LuSEE-Night is an exciting proposed collaboration between NASA and Department of Energy (DOE) to send a pathfinder radio telescope to the far side of the Moon. 

LuSEE stands for Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment. The full experiment is split into the LuSEE-Light component, which focuses on the Solar science and LuSEE-Night, which focuses on the galactic and extra-galactic radio astronomy at very low frequencies (0.1-50MHz).

LuSEE-Night is manifested to fly to the Moon on NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program flight CS-3 in early 2025. It will use the ESA's Lunar Pathfinder Communication Satellite to communicate with Earth. It will observe radio sky using 4 monopole antennas from the far side of the Moon for up to 24 lunar cycles after landing. Results will provide the most constraining measurements of the radio sky in this frequency range.

## The Big Picture

The Cosmic Microwave Background is the main pillar of modern observational cosmology. This is radiation released some 400 thousand years after the Big Bang, when the primordial cosmic plasma made of mostly hydrogen and helium atoms immersed in the sea of photons and electrons cools to the temperature at which photons and matter decouple: matter forms neutral hydrogen atoms and light begins to propagate freely through the universe. This same radiation, redshifted to mm wavelengths, is observed today as the CMB. The large distance lever arm of the CMB, and our ability to model the physics using easily solvable linear equations, makes it a truly unique probe, upon which most of the other cosmological probes build upon.

The hundred million years following the formation of the CMB, corresponding to redshifts between z~1100 and z~30, are referred to as the Dark Ages. This is the epoch after the primeval fireball has cooled down, but before the first stars lit up.  At these redshifts, cosmological density fluctuations can be directly probed with the 21\,cm line whose physics is completely described by [well-understood processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0702600) governed by gravity, atomic physics, and thermodynamics.   Once the first stars begin to form at z~30, their emitted radiation alters the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, which depends on complex non-linear astrophysics, and disallows the first-principles understanding present at previous times. Therefore, the Dark Ages present an incredible opportunity in terms of precision cosmology, essentially free of astrophysical complexity. However, precisely for the same reason, this epoch is not amenable to the traditional surveys used to probe the evolved Universe, which use galaxies or other objects to trace the underlying distribution of matter.

Redshifted 21-cm emission and absorption from neutral hydrogen is _the single known method_ that allows, at least in principle, observations of this period in the evolution of the Universe. This emission corresponds to the energy difference between the spins of the electron and proton that are aligned or not aligned in a hydrogen atom. There is no other line in its vicinity and hence it is not easily confused with electromagnetic interaction by other species. The theory of 21cm emission from the Dark Ages is very well understood: fluctuations in 21cm emission are sourced by density, temperature and velocity perturbations, which we can calculate from first principles at those redshifts.  This has been recognized [decades ago](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0312134), but the practicalities are daunting, starting with the fact that the signal is redshifted outside the windows of atmospheric transparency that would allow observations from the Earth's surface.
This measurement would, however, provide the holy grail of cosmology, as it probes the same linear physics as  CMB experiments, while mapping more three-dimensional Fourier modes of the density field than available in large-scale redshift surveys.  This signal has the potential to enable the ultimate sensitivity to the cosmological parameters, including those from early-universe inflation and primordial gravitational waves.  However, we have to recognize that this is the end-game that will take decades to develop, should it even prove technically possible.

Another analogy with the CMB is appropriate. The CMB monopole signal (i.e. the CMB itself) was discovered in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson for which they received the Nobel Prize in 1978. This discovery was extremely informative and has established the Big Bang theory as the leading cosmological theory. It took another 26 years for the COBE Satellite to measure _spatial fluctuations_ in the CMB, for which George Smoot received the Nobel Prize in 2006. It is notable that George Smoot was an employee of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, illustrating the great science that can be achieved when DOE and NASA collaborate. The discovery of fluctuations and their subsequent characterization with the WMAP and Planck missions cemented the CMB as the cornerstone of cosmological observations. A similar timeline could play out with the Dark Ages 21-cm signal. A detection of the monopole is feasible over the next decade and it would take several decades to work our way towards detection of fluctuations. This would be the arc of a long-term science roadmap towards a new and truly transformational tool for cosmology.

The first stage in the program is the detection of the Dark Ages monopole. Shown in Figure above, this signal is a small dip in the observed radiation intensity as a function of frequency  integrated over the entire celestial sphere. It will be detected  by measuring a broad absorption trough centered at around 20~MHz. Because the physics is linear and well-understood, we have a prediction for the size and shape of this effect. Any deviation from this template would have immediate and profound implications for fundamental physics. Because there are no astrophysical uncertainties, it would necessarily imply new physics once the possible sources of systematics have been ruled out. The most plausible way of changing the shape and amplitude of this trough is through heating and cooling of the cosmic medium through non-standard processes. Therefore, the Dark Ages dip in the monopole of radiation is the \textbf{cosmic calorimeter} that can measure the net energy flows in the baryon fluid. A large number of theoretical proposals exist which can cause deviations from the simplest predictions~\cite{1903.06212}, including dark matter-baryon scattering~\cite{1509.00029,1408.2571,1803.06698,1803.09734}, millicharged dark matter~\cite{1802.10094,1803.03091}, dark-matter annihilation~\cite{1211.0283,1604.02457}, primordial black holes~\cite{1803.09390}, axions~\cite{1804.10378}, neutrino decay, charge sequestration~\cite{1803.10096}, quark nuggets, dark photons~\cite{1809.01139}, interacting dark energy~\cite{1803.07555} and even a drift in the value of the fundamental constants~\cite{astro-ph/0701752}. We recommedn reading Astro2020 Decadal Survey Submission \cite{1903.06212}. These are all topics of high interest to the HEP community and can be probed from the lunar surface within the next decade independently of astrophysics. 
Detection of the monopole would require setting up a low-resolution and high-efficiency radio telescope either stationary on the far side of the Moon or in the orbit around the Moon.

LUSEE-Night is the 

For example, either the Dark Ages Polarimeter PathfindER (DAPPER),\footnote{See \href{https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/dapper.pdf}{Dark Ages Polarimeter PathfindER (DAPPER) poster}.} a proposed Dark Ages experiment in lunar orbit,  or the Lunar Crater Radio Telescope (LCRT)\footnote{See \href{https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020_Phase_I_Phase_II/lunar_crater_radio_telescope/}{Lunar Crater Radio Telescope (LCRT) on the Far-Side of the Moon}.}~\cite{LCRT}, a proposed NIAC concept of a 1-km diameter parabolic mesh reflector in a lunar farside crater, would provide high-sensitivity measurement of the monopole signal in the Dark Ages.  


Similar to the evolution of the CMB, the path towards detection of the fluctuations would involve working over several decades with radio telescopes of increasing size and complexity on the lunar farside. After detection of the monopole, an experiment such as FARSIDE\footnote{See \href{https://www.colorado.edu/ness/farside-low-radio-frequency-interferometric-array-lunar-farside}{FARSIDE homepage}.}~\cite{1911.08649} would be the next step in this program. Farside would make high-spectral-resolution maps of the global signal, but it is unlikely that it would be able to actually map the spatial fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen during the Dark Ages. It would likely put severe constraints on the models of new physics aforementioned. After FARSIDE, bigger and more powerful interferometers will be built, echoing a similar development in CMB technologies in the 1970s and 1980s, which culminated in the detection of CMB fluctuations in the 1990s. These instruments will require significant infrastructural development on the Moon, including the provision of power and significant bandwidth. With such a futuristic apparatus, we can hope to detect fluctuations across the sky and thus open a new era of observational cosmology a few decades from now.


As a general probe, a Dark Ages Lunar experiment would be able to probe primordial fluctuations deep into what were linear scales at the time, but which are deep in the non-linear regime today and whose information has been largely lost. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:mpk} which demonstrates the science usability of such probes for any probe whose power depends on the number of linear modes and their scales.
