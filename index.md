# Welcome to LuSEE@Night!

Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment (LuSEE)
will rely on the NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.
Once delivered to the far side of the Moon, LuSEE, operating at frequencies
from 100 kHz to a few tens of MHz, will investigate the plasma environment
above the lunar surface and measure the fidelity of radio spectra on the surface.
It will use electrically-short, spiral-tube deployable antennas and radio
spectrometers to measure the local magnetic field and exo-ionospheric density,
interplanetary radio bursts, Jovian and terrestrial natural radio emission,
and the galactic synchrotron spectrum.
